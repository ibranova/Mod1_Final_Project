# ‚òï ‚òïÔ∏è Cafe Financial Analysis & Insights

## Project Overview
This project was conducted to help a small caf√© owner better understand their sales trends. By analyzing transaction-level data, we aimed to identify peak sales times, best-selling items, and customer behavior across the week and year. The insights are intended to guide smarter inventory and marketing decisions. 

## üß† Business Problem & Stakeholder

The caf√© owner wanted to answer several key questions:
- **What are the peak sales months?**
- **Are weekends busier than weekdays?**
- **Which products generate the most revenue?**
- **How reliable is the dataset?**
The primary stakeholder is the caf√© owner, who can utilize these insights to enhance profitability and operational efficiency.

## üßπ Data Cleaning Choices & Justification
- **Data Type Corrections:** Converted `Transaction Date` to datetime; `Price Per Unit`, `Quantity`, and `Total Spent` to numeric
- **Missing Data:** Used mapping dictionaries and Excel filters to infer missing item names and prices based on other columns
- **Duplicates:** Checked for and found no duplicate rows
- **Dropped/Imputed Columns:** Replaced 'ERROR' and 'UNKNOWN' entries with `NaN`; inferred some missing values via formulas (e.g. Price = Total / Quantity)
- **Feature Engineering:** Created `Month` and `Day Of The Week` columns for further analysis


## üîç Key Findings
- **Most sold item by quantity:** Sandwich
- **Highest revenue item:** Salad

- **Busiest Day:** 
- Maximum sales on Thursday $12401.5, minimum - on Wednesday $11680.5. The difference is small, so the demand is stable.

- **Weekends showed higher average spending**
- **Payment Method:** Payment method was roughly equally distributed across categories, with each method taking roughly 33% of the total
- Payment method and ordering location do not affect the sales volume.

## ü§î Reflections
- **Challenges:** Ambiguous item-price mapping (e.g. $3 could be Cake or Juice, or $4 could be Smoothie or Sandwich)
- **Biases:** Imputations were based on assumptions; might not fully represent real-world behaviors
- **Next Time:** Add a unique transaction ID and explore customer loyalty patterns or time-of-day effects

## ‚úÖ Takeaways & Recommendations

- Salads and Sandwiches and Smoothie generate the most revenue
- Increase inventory of **Sandwiches** and **Salads**
- Focus staffing and marketing efforts on **weekends** and **Thursdays**
- Use **slow months** to experiment with discounts or new menu items
- Potential to increase the average total spending by offering combos
- Consider promotions on days with slightly lower demand (e.g. Wednesday)
- Improve data entry to minimize 'ERROR'/'UNKNOWN' records in the future
